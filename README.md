This is a template repo for training and publishing your own custom Stable Diffusion model using Replicate and GitHub Actions.

It uses [replicate.com/replicate/dreambooth](https://replicate.com/replicate/dreambooth) to train the model using your custom imagery.

## Preqrequisites

- A paid Replicate account

1. Add images to the `data` directory of your forked repo.
